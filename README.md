## 句型

### 简单句

主语+动词：

> John Smith died in World War Two.

这里的“动词”，叫做“不及物动词”：像die这种动作，可以独立发生，不牵涉到别的人或物。

主语+动词+宾语：

> John Smith killed three enemy soldiers.

这里的动词，叫做“及物动词”：像kill这种动作，必须发生在另一个对象的身上，意思才能够完整。

主语+动词+补语：

> John Smith was a soldier.
> John Smith was courageous.

如果“主语+动词+宾语”的句型缺少了宾语，尚还能表达出部分意思，只是不完整，而如果“主语+动词+补语”的句型缺少了补语，则完全没有意义。

一个主语如果配合一个动词都还不能构成一个有意义的完整句子，则需要补语来补足。

这一类解释为“是”的动词（叫“连缀动词”），没有叙述能力，只能扮演引导叙述部分的角色：be, look, seem, appear, sound, feel, taste, turn, prove, become, make.

主语+动词+宾语+补语：

> John's father called him a dog.
> I find the dress pretty.

宾语和补语之间虽然没有“是”字，可是带有这种暗示存在。

主语+动词+宾语+宾语：

> John's father gave him a dog.

him和a dog都是宾语，且不是“是”的关系。

### the的用法

凡是上下文中有明指或暗示时，也就是有“那个”的指示功能时，便要用定冠词the：

> I need a book to read on my trip.
> I have finished the book you lent me.
> I'm going to the office now.

专有名词一般不用加定冠词the，除非特指“那个”：

> This is not the John Smith I know.
> This is John Smith.

海洋、河流、群岛、群山、杂志名、船名等要加定冠词the，是因为这些名词充当的是形容词，修饰的是隐藏了的名词：

> the Pacific (Ocean) 太平洋
> the Altantic (Ocean) 大西洋
> the Indian Ocean 印度洋 - 没有省略掉Ocean，因为省略了就有歧义了
> the Mediterranean (Sea) 地中海
> the Dead Sea 死海 - 没有省略Sea，否则歧义
> the Philipphine Islands -> the Philipphines 菲律宾群岛
> the Alp Mountains -> the Alps 阿尔比斯山
> the Mississippi (River) 密西西比河
> the Titanic (Ship) 泰坦尼克号
> the Hilton (Hotel) 希尔顿饭店
> the United States of American

如果把这些名词短语的第三个部分还原，即可看出它们的名词位置都是普通名词，所以都可以加冠词。the United States of American在名词位置的其实是普通名词States，所以加the，而American本身是专有名词，所以前面没有冠词。


### 简单式和完成式

简单式的时间表示动作发生的时间，完成式的时间表示一个截止时间。

> The U.S. established diplomatic relations with the P.R.C. in 1979. // 过去时

> The movable print was introduced to England in 1485.

> I was visiting clients the whole day yesterday.

> I was watching TV when I heard the doorbell.

> The witness was being questioned in court when he had a heart attack.

> Huang pitches a fast ball. Li swings. It looks like a hit. The shortstop fails to stop it. It's a double! // 现在时

> All mothers love their children.

> 7-ELEVEN is selling big cokes at a discount this month.

> According to the NASA survey, the ozone layer is being depleted.

> There will be a major election in March. // 将来时

> Don't call me at six tomorrow. I'll still be sleeping then.

> The building will be razed next month.

完成式

> I'm sure I have seen this face somewhere. // 现在时

> We have been working overtime for a week to fill your order.

> The house has been redecorated twice since they moved in.

> Many soldiers had died from pneumonia before the discovery of penicillin. // 过去时

> I had been smoking three packs of cigarettes a day before I decided to quit.

> Japan had not been defeated yet by the time Germany surrendered unconditionally.

> Next April, I will have worked here for 20 years. // 将来时

> Come back at 5:00. Your car will have been fixed by then.

> In two more minutes, she will have been talking on the phone for three hours.

句子中的next April，开起来好像要用简单式，可是另外还有一个时间副词for 20 years，是一个箭头。你不可能在四月到这个月内替公司工作20年，所以next April只是一个截止时间，表示“算到四月为止有20年”来修饰动词，所以要用完成式。

### 语气助动词与不定词

所有重要的语气助动词，都可以改写为不定词：

must - have to
should - ought to
will/would - be going to
can/could - be able to
may/might - be likely to

> It may rain any minute.
